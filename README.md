- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gawlikaj
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in not only continuing learning about embedded systems, but applying my knowledge as well in order to broaden my experience as I look for an entry-level position in embedded systems in the Chicago area.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the ESP32 microcontroller, the wired communication protocols it supports (SPI, I2C), and how to utilize a RTOS.  I may explore usage of wireless protocols supported by the ESP32-WROOM later in the project, but I am taking it a step at a time.  I am also teaching myself how to use PCB design tools such as EagleCAD and KiCad.
